- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xandaron
- ðŸŒ± I have completed a bachelors in computer science at the University of York
- I'm an aspiring developer with a love in particular for graphics programmer.

Current projects:
- [Valhalla](https://github.com/xandaron/valhalla): A renderer written in odin using Vulkan, GLFW and imgui, Valhalla is a labour I have build over the course of a year. From having 0 clue what Vulkan was or how to render a triangle to a screen to creating a full interactive renderer I have learnt a LOT from this project. I'm proud of what it has become and what the future holds.
- [Bragi](https://github.com/xandaron/Bragi): A fun side project I created as a CLI tool that processes images using compute shaders written by the user. This tool was mainly created just to have some fun with compute shaders and image processing however I believe ended up as a piece of software I belive is truly useful.
